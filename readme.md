# useCount hook for showing counting numbers

- import the useCount hook to your file which is located at /src/useCount or just copy or paste the code.
- initialize the useCount hook like the example below

```
  const [countValue, startCounting] = useCounter({
    from: 20,
    to: 100,
    interval: 50
  });
```

`from` is the starting point for the counter to start, `to` is the ending point for the counter to end and the `interval` is the interval between the counters.

- You can see the example on the src/App.js
